## Sampling
The file SamplingK20.R is used to sample subjects into studies/reference image for each run.
Results are saved in data frames which are used later on. This file also produces the distribution of the sample sizes of all individual studies (distrSampleSizes.txt).

## Main code
Creating the test and evaluation condition is done with the main_CBMA_K20.sh file.
This file needs to be run for I = 3 times in which argument `$RUN` should be altered.
All other files are helper files!
