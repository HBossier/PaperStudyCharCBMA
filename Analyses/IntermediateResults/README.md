Intermediate Results
===========

This folder contains the intermediate results. They are obtained by calculating the summary of interest on the raw data/results using the **R** file [ProcesRawData.R]().

We have:
* TFPR\_K\_* which are True and False Positive Rates for all MAs, given a number of studies (K) in the folder *TFPR*.
* AUC_VALUES\_K\_* which are the values for the Area Under the Curve of the average ROC curve, given K in the folder *AUC_avgFPTP*.
* AUC_long\_K\_* which are the values for the Area Under the Curve of each ROC curve from each run/fold, given K in the folder *AUC_long*. 
* Overlap\_K\_* which are the values for the activation reliability, given K in the folder Overlap.


> Note: directories pointing to the raw data are not provided here.
